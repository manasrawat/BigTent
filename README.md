# Big Tent

This was my project (developed from summer 2019 to early 2020) for the A-level Computer Science NEA, which got cancelled because of Covid. Read the report [here](https://github.com/manasrawat/BigTent/blob/main/nea%20manas%20rawat.pdf).

The back-end part is in the [JSON Breakdown](https://github.com/manasrawat/JSONBreakdown) repository.
